#MentorMatching

#About:

A windows application with a Mentor-Mentee algorithm that matches mentee signups to mentors from the same department. 
It takes in two excel files and outputs matched results based on the department and availability of mentors.
This project is for an organization called the Association of Indian Students at the University of Southern California.

#Motivation:

I was part of the mentorship program team.
The program aids in connecting incoming graduate Indian students with the current students.
I realised as graduate students, spending time and effort in matching mentors to mentees manually was time consuming and the 
process was being delayed. 
I developed this tool to automate the process.

#Future:

I have plans of integrating the mail system which can take in inputs and send out emails to the mentors and mentees with matched details.
I would also like to make the fields more dynamic.
